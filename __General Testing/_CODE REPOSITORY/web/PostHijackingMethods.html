<strong>Hijacking a Form Post</strong> - How and why do we do it?</strong><br><br>   
Why would you need to do this?  Well there are a number of reasons
<BR/>&middot;<strong>The form is outside of our code, and we cannot track the click inside our code.</strong> -  
This is always the context on .NET forms and sometimes on other forms.  Often, the form will have bunch of hidden
values, and we would rather they populate those and us not have to read them (which we would have to if the form was in 
the hidden content, opened and closed, and thus had to be replicated in our copy/snippet).
<BR/>&middot;<strong>Can track this click but want to change the post action based on path changes</strong> - 
In QA and we want to have it work transparently, this is always the way we want to work it.
<br/><br/>
<strong style="color:#88FF88;"> 
In this example, we just have a form, and we want to hijack the form action so we can track it.   <br/><br/>
It's a multi-step process.  First we figure out what the base URL is.  This can be either from a base statement or
more likely from just figuring out the base URL using javascript.<br/><br/>
Next, we create a dummy POST click-thru.  You creating a dummy form tag with a full-path action URL, name the form, then run
it through the Template Wizard. Then add the click-thru to the variable <u><em>daPost</em></u>.  I have examples of the before
and after for this code, just view source and see. <br/><br><strong style="color:#cc6666;">REMEMBER, YOU CAN ONLY CREATE A POST CLICK BY HAVING A FORM 
WITH A FULL-PATH ACTION URL AND RUNNING IT THROUGH THE WIZARD!!!  You CANNOT create a post click manually. </strong>
<br/><br>When you do this, remember to add the "oppost" parameter to the clickthru.
