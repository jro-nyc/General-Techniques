<strong>Hijacking a Form Post</strong> - How and why do we do it?</strong><br><br>   
Why would you need to do this?  Well there are a number of reasons
<BR/>&middot;<strong>The form is outside of our code, and we cannot track the click inside our code.</strong> -  
This is always the context on .NET forms and sometimes on other forms.  Often, the form will have bunch of hidden
values, and we would rather they populate those and us not have to read them (which we would have to if the form was in 
the hidden content, opened and closed, and thus had to be replicated in our copy/snippet).
<BR/>&middot;<strong>Can track this click but want to change the post action based on path changes</strong> - 
In QA and we want to have it work transparently, this is always the way we want to work it.
<br/><br/>
<strong style="color:#88FF88;"> 
In this example, we just have a form, and we want to hijack the form action so we can track it.   <br/><br/>
It's a multi-step process.  First we figure out what the base URL is.  This can be either from a base statement or
more likely from just figuring out the base from the Domain using javascript.<br/><br/>
Next, we create a dummy POST click-thru.  Just define one, adding it to  the variable <u><em>daPost</em></u> (done in the code below), then run
it through the Template Wizard, then make sure that in the clickthru, under Advanced, you set it to a POST, not GET. I have examples of the before
and after for this code, just view source and see.
<br/><br>When you do this, remember to add the "oppost" parameter to the clickthru.
</strong><br/><br/><strong style="color:FF0000;"><u>22 Feb 2007</u><br/>MOD - Found another quirky instance, we had a client who decided to name a hidden input "action"... nice ...
 so now accessing document.formName.action gets the hidden input, NOT the form action. Had to access the form action using the <u>attributes</u> 
 property instead</strong>

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
// Hijacking the POST for easier debugging.
if(document.getElementsByTagName('base')[0] != null){ // If we have a base statement, use that to set the root path
	daRoot = document.getElementsByTagName('base')[0].href;
	var orig = daRoot.split("//");
	protocol = orig[0] + '//';
	var dir = orig[1].split("/");
	var dirs = "";
	for(var i=0;i<dir.length-1;i++){
		dirs += (dir[i]!=''?dir[i] + '/':'');  
	
	}
	daBaseDomain = protocol + dir[0];
	daDomain = protocol + dir[0] + '/';
	daRoot = protocol + dirs;
	//alert('Got the root from the base statement and it is ' + daRoot + ' and the root domain is ' + daDomain)
}
else {
	var sPage = window.location.pathname;
	var dir = sPage.split("/");
