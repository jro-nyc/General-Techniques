	Well, there are number of specific reasons why.  But let's start from the top:<br/>
	The differences can be boiled down to the architecural philosohpy behind the engines that run the two browsers - <u>the struggle of Equality versus Freedom</u><br/>
	<ul>
	IE, architected by a capitalist pig who wants to make the most money possible by 
	making life easy for the unwashed masses, has <u>Freedom</u> as it's Philosophical underpining....  
	<strong>"We've decided to add a feature that makes your life easier, we're not going to ask for anyones approval, and we think you'll like it."</strong><br/><br/>
	So it tends to overlook:
	<li>Bad HTML</li>
	<li>Bad CSS</li>
	<li>Bad coding in general</li><br/><br/>
	Firefox (and Mozilla and Netscape), on the other hand, developed by left-wing Unix types that 
	spend their lives in Universities/government settings not cutting their hair or bathing, use <u>Equality</u> 
	as their Philosophical underpining.... <strong>"The people's committee has decided that every Internet user has the <u>right</u> to the same user experience, we think you'll like it."</strong><br/><br/>
	Now I will grant you that Equality is necessary in certain areas - which side of the road to drive on immediately comes to mind - 
	but the inevitable rigid beurocracy usually results in innovation and efficiency being sacrificed (ie. The Soviet Union and New York City government).<br/><br/>	
	
	Gecko Engine, that runs Firefox et al, is W3C compliant and that's it.  You want to add a propery, method, etc, 
	you gotta go to the W3C politburo, and maybe a few years later it gets approved.  IE, though, says, hey, why don't we do this,
	it will make it easier on the programmers, and they do it. But since we have to work with both, we need to accomadate the commies.<br/><br/>	
	
	So this means that there may be improperly formated HTML on the page, and if you did 
	not notice this when you started the template, now you pay for it. 
	Specifically, things like:
	<li>unclosed tags or unopened tr, td, table, div, span, etc tags</li>
	<li>reading the innerHTML of tables or rows</li><br/><br/>
	Technically (as in W3C compliance) you need to close all your tags, you can only read 
	the innerHTML of valid cells (tr th, and tables are not valid cells).<br/>AND there are a number of functions, methods, properties, 
	that IE implements that are not W3C compliant, so be careful. Like outerHTML, document.all[].  So you need to be careful when coding.
	<br/><br/>
	You may also have some issue where the page renders differently in the Agency or QA, go to #3 for more details.
	<br/><br/>So remember to thank the MoveOn.org types that came up with this next time you're mad about this.

		Well, let's think about this. Remember, web pages have no state, there's no magical server calls, everything has to be 
		in the browser or accessible via the DOM.  So a page that worked great on their site suddenly triggers a thousand and one errors. 
		Make sure debug is set on IE or you look at the javascript console on Firefox, and debug the errors.  
		<strong>YOU MUST DO THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.</strong>
	<br/><br/><strong><u>Cookies -</u></strong> If the page is pulling cookies and acting based on their state, this will not work. 
	<br/><br/><strong><u>Query string parameters -</u></strong> If the page is pulling Query string parameters and acting based 
	on their state, you will need to figure/find out out what the paremeters are and put them in the URL to simulate proper behavior.
	<br/><br/><strong><u>Frames -</u></strong> If there are Frames on the page (frames or iframes), there are domain security issues 
	that may prevent you from doing stuff

		This is caused by browser limitations or, in rare instances, errors in your javascript code. Here's the deal:
		<br/><br/>When a browser loads a page, it starts at the top and loads the content, line by line.  When it gets to a 
		<strong>tag referencing external content</strong> (could be script or link tag), it goes to the src URL location 
		to call and then load the returned content,	and then renders it. If it is inline content, it executes the javacript immediately.<br/><br/>
		So when it gets to the Optimost Trial code, it calls us and	we send it a document.write that contains/encapsulates the HTML content and any 
		javascript blocks with native="no".  Script blocks that don't have native="no" are executed as inline script.  
		This can result in the following issues:
		<ul>
			<li>If you have script blocks inside our copy (inside the content we render, you may hear me call this phenomenon <strong>a script block inside of a script block</strong>), those will NOT be executed until the entire document.write is finished.
				This means that if the content of that internal script block is inline rendered content - say an inline document.write - it will now be rendered in the wrong place,
				at the end of our code, which may not even be a valid cell so it may show up anywhere. To work around this, you must:
				<ul style="padding:0;">
					<li>Read the content of the script call (go to the URL) and insert it in the same place on the page as inline script.  
					Only do this if it is inline rendered content(HTML)</li>
					<li>Make sure from the Client that this code will not be changing for the duration of the test</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If you are referencing new elements by id, tagname, etc, that are in the rendered copy, some browsers may not execute them correctly 
				(which is a nice way of saying the Commie Gecko browsers).  What happens is that the contents of the document.write are not 
				entered into the DOM tree until the script is completely finished executing.  So getElementById fails. So what to do?
				<ul style="padding:0;">
					<li>Don't use <strong>document.getElementById</strong> if at all possible.  Always do a document.write if you can</li>
					<li>If you can't do a document.write, put the code containing the <strong>document.getElementById</strong> at the 
					bottom of the page in a separate script block with <strong>native="no" </strong>set in the script tag definition</li>
				</ul>			
			</li>
		</ul>

		This is caused by browser inconsistencies in implementing CSS. Here's the deal, part of it:
		<br/><br/>CSS is not implemented identically across browsers, which is in fact the main motivation behind changes to IE 7. 
		There are a bunch of things that can cause problems, here is a short list.
		<ul>
			<li>Adding style to paragraph -'&lt;P&gt;'- tags
				<ul style="padding:0;">
					<li>Paragraph tags are very popular because they give you paragraph breaks between blocks of text.  Great</li>
					<li>But if you try to add more padding using styles.... well, <strong>DON'T DO IT!!</strong>.  Firefox would add a bunch of extra spacing and mess it up.</li>
					<li><strong>Solution</strong> - just create a DIV with top and bottom padding equal to the line height, and then add additional padding incrementally to those baseline numbers </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>DIV blocks floating inside DIV or TABLE cell
				<ul style="padding:0;">
					<li>This almost always arises from starting with client code, CSS based pages, and they don't give us HTML. So we have to wing it</li>
					<li>An aside - this is the ongoing question of what does the client supply, table that discussion for now</li>
					<li>We should make sure to create these elements in the cleanest and most understandable manner.  This sound vague, but usually means creating a table within the cell of interest since you can easily determine spacing for that.</li>
					
				</ul>
